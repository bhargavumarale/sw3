Online menus with photographs of the meals prepared, and detail descriptions of their ingredients help both students and parents make the right nutritional choices. Each student or staff member who accesses the canteen could be provided with a School Canteen Account on the school website that keeps tracks track of their previous meal choices and any dietary requirements they may have. Ordering online by ticking a box and paying for meals online can eliminate all the fuss of money handling, making ti safer and less complication for staff and students alike. Here again, diversity is the key.

                    <p class="list-group-item-text col-lg-7 col-md-7 col-sm-7 col-xs-12">1. Accuracy
                        Humans are pone to error, even if we provide them with supporting computational devices. Automated attendance management system ensure accurate time record and and minimize the inevitable and costly error with manual data entry. This accurate data thereby helps to provide accurate performance and payroll data.
                        <br>
                        2. Economics
                        Have you ever thought that attendance management system could control costs? It saves money by putting an end to inaccurate time reporting, buddy punching, absenteeism, tardiness, tine abuse, and overpayment. As a matter of fact, a study done by the Axsium Group found that large organizations save up to $1,600 per employee after implementing automated attendance management systems.

                        3. Productivity / Efficiency
                        Monitoring and managing attendance
                        manually can a time-consuming, laborious, and expensive affair. It takes time to process paper sheets and time card, create schedules, authorize leave and overtime, and create payroll manually. Free up precious administration time with time with an automated system that does it all for you, from keeping track of employee hours to automatically importing information into payroll system. The time and effort saved combined with data accuracy help in optimizing the use of resources which lead to increased productivity and improves profits.
